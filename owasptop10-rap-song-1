PROMPT: Write a rap song lyrics about owasp top 10

RESPONSE:

Verse 1:
Let me tell y'all 'bout a list that's a must-see,
OWASP Top 10, cyber threats that could end you and me
Injection, XSS, and broken authentication,
Don't be caught slipping, it's time to take some action

Chorus:
OWASP Top 10, don't get caught out,
Learn the risks, take precautions, don't even doubt
It's time to get serious, don't let hackers win,
Secure your data, don't let the bad guys in

Verse 2:
Cross-site scripting, man, it's no joke,
They'll steal your info, your accounts all broke
SQL injection, they'll mess up your data,
Or use your site for spam, like some old-school hater

Chorus:
OWASP Top 10, don't get caught out,
Learn the risks, take precautions, don't even doubt
It's time to get serious, don't let hackers win,
Secure your data, don't let the bad guys in

Verse 3:
Insecure deserialization, it's a hard one to say,
But it means danger, so don't let it get in your way
A bit of broken access control, and you'll be stung,
Your secure data will be compromised, your business undone

Chorus:
OWASP Top 10, don't get caught out,
Learn the risks, take precautions, don't even doubt
It's time to get serious, don't let hackers win,
Secure your data, don't let the bad guys in

Verse 4:
Security misconfiguration, it's like leaving the door wide,
For hackers to walk in, and take you for a ride,
Don't let them exploit you, protect your apps from the start,
Then you'll be ahead of the game, with a guarded heart

Chorus:
OWASP Top 10, don't get caught out,
Learn the risks, take precautions, don't even doubt
It's time to get serious, don't let hackers win,
Secure your data, don't let the bad guys in

Outro:
So that's OWASP Top 10, and what it means for you,
Get ahead of the game, and do what you gotta do,
Secure your networks, and code with care,
And when the bad guys come, they'll be met with a cyber warfare.
