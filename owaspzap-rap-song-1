(Verse 1)

Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell
'Bout a program that'll keep your website outta hell
OWASP ZAP, that's the tool you need
To scan your code and make sure it's clean, indeed

It's an open source project, that means it's free
No need to spend cash, just download it with glee
Run it on your site, see what it finds
Fix the vulnerabilities and leave the hackers behind

(Chorus)

OWASP ZAP, it's the best in the game
Protecting your site, it's a certified aim
With its powerful tools, you'll never feel the pain
Keep your site secure, never worry again

(Verse 2)

Injection attacks, cross site scripting
OWASP ZAP can detect them, no messing
Out of date components, insecure storage
ZAP will find 'em all, no need for a forage

With its automated scans, and detailed reports
You'll know exactly where to fix, no need for retorts
And if you're a pro, the API's for you
Integrate with your tools, and watch your website renew

(Chorus)

OWASP ZAP, it's the best in the game
Protecting your site, it's a certified aim
With its powerful tools, you'll never feel the pain
Keep your site secure, never worry again

(Bridge)

So if you're building a website, and security's a must
OWASP ZAP is the tool, that should be your first
Download it now, and give it a spin
Keep your site safe, from those hackers within

(Chorus)

OWASP ZAP, it's the best in the game
Protecting your site, it's a certified aim
With its powerful tools, you'll never feel the pain
Keep your site secure, never worry again.
